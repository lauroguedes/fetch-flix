         * `throw` is on. A write that returns false instead of raising would be
         * recorded as a successful download of a file that is not there, and
         * only surface later as a broken stream.
         *
         * No `visibility` key. Setting one makes Flysystem send an ACL header on
         * every write, which R2 rejects. Objects are private by bucket policy
         * and reached only through short-lived pre-signed URLs.
